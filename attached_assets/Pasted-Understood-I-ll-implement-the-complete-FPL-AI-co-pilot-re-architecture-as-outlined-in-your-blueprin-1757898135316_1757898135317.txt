Understood! I'll implement the complete FPL AI co-pilot re-architecture as outlined in your blueprint without stopping until it's fully working. Let me begin systematically implementing each component.

Now I'll implement the complete FPL AI co-pilot re-architecture. Let me start with Phase 1: Enhanced Data Foundation, beginning with integrating advanced performance metrics from Understat.

I can see the current system has a foundation with mock services. Now I'll implement the real data sources as outlined in your blueprint. Let me start by installing the necessary packages and implementing the Understat API integration for real xG/xA data.

Now I'll install TheOddsAPI package and implement the enhanced data foundation. Based on my research, I'll use TheOddsAPI for betting odds and implement Understat data through web scraping since there's no direct Node.js wrapper.

Now I'll implement the real data providers as outlined in the blueprint. Let me start by creating a real TheOddsAPI provider to replace the mock odds service, then implement Understat data integration.

Now I'll create an Understat provider for real xG/xA data. Since there's no direct Node.js API, I'll implement web scraping as recommended in the blueprint.

Now I'll implement the OpenFPL baseline model as outlined in the blueprint. This will be a position-specific ensemble forecasting engine with XGBoost-like capabilities adapted for Node.js.

I need to fix the LSP errors before continuing. Let me check what they are and fix them.

Let me check and fix the LSP errors before continuing with the implementation.

Checked code issues
I need to fix the type errors before continuing. Let me address these systematically:

Now I'll implement the Monte Carlo simulation layer as outlined in the blueprint. This will provide probabilistic forecasting instead of single-point estimates.

Now I need to continue implementing the enhanced features. I've implemented:

✅ Real TheOddsAPI provider for betting odds
✅ Real Understat provider for xG/xA data (with web scraping)
✅ OpenFPL baseline model with position-specific ensemble regressors
✅ Monte Carlo simulation layer for probabilistic forecasting
Next I need to implement:
5. Player consistency modeling (Coefficient of Variation)

Effective Ownership modeling for rank optimization
Update the ML prediction engine to use these new engines
Enhanced AI responses with strategic insights
Let me continue by implementing the Coefficient of Variation modeling and updating the ML prediction engine to incorporate all these new capabilities.

Now I'll implement the Coefficient of Variation modeling for player consistency and update the ML prediction engine to incorporate all the new advanced capabilities. Let me also update the AI copilot to use these enhanced engines.

Let me read the ML prediction engine file first and then continue with the implementation.

Good! The application is running successfully. Now let me update the ML prediction engine to incorporate all the advanced capabilities we've implemented. Let me continue with the implementation:
