Should I keep Watkins or transfer him out

11:29 PM

Okay, let's tackle the user's question. They want to know if they should keep Ollie Watkins (£8.9m) or transfer him out. Let me start by looking at the current squad data provided.

Watkins is in the starting XI with 8 points total and an expected 2.6 points per game. Comparing him to other forwards, there's João Pedro (£7.7m) with 33 total points and Wood (£7.7m) on the bench with 18 points. Pedro's points are better, but he's a different position. Wood is a forward on the bench, but his points are lower than Watkins. Wait, Watkins is a forward, right? His position says FWD for AVL. But his total points are only 8, which is quite low. Maybe his performance hasn't been great so far.

Looking at the fixtures. For GW4, the team is facing BUR (A) where Salah and others are playing. Watkins isn't listed in the fixtures for GW4, so he might not have a game that week. In GW5, the team's fixture is vs MUN (A, FDR 4), which is tough. GW6 is against LIV (H, FDR 3), which is a bit better. So Watkins might not play in GW4, meaning he's not contributing there.

The chip strategy mentions a Free-Hit in GW4 because only 5 players have fixtures. If the user uses Free-Hit, they can bring in players from better fixture teams for that week. But Watkins isn't in GW4's fixtures, so maybe replacing him for that week could help. However, the user only has 1 free transfer and no money in the bank. Transfading him out would cost money unless they can get a profit from selling him.

In the bench, there's Wood (£7.7m) with 18 points. If Watkins is not playing in GW4, maybe swapping him with Wood could be considered. But Wood's team (NFO) has fixtures in GW4 vs BUR, which is FDR 2.5. However, the user's current squad has Wood on the bench and Watkins in the XI. Wait, but Watkins isn't playing in GW4, so starting Wood instead might gain points if NFO vs BUR is a good matchup. However, Wood's total points are 18, but his expected might be lower? The data doesn't specify, but maybe Wood has a better fixture.

Also, looking at the other forwards: João Pedro is in the starting XI, but he's a CHE player and their fixtures might not be favorable. For example, in GW4, Sánchez (CHE GK) is playing against BUR (A, FDR 2.5), which is a lower FDR than some others. But Watkins isn't in that game. If the user has a forward spot where Watkins is not playing, maybe selling him for another player who is playing could be beneficial, especially if they can afford it with the bank of £0.6m.

But Watkins' price is £8.9m, and the bench has Estève (£4m) and others. If the user transfers him out, they need to bring someone cheaper or have enough bank. Since the bank is £0.6m, they can only afford a similar or lower-priced player. However, with a wildcard in GW10, maybe holding onto Watkins for the long term is better if his fixtures improve later. But his current form is poor—8 points total and 2.6 exp. If there's no upcoming games in GW4, maybe it's better to swap him out for a player with a game that week, even if it's a temporary move.

Wait, the user's current squad has Watkins in FWD, AVL. AVL's next games are in GW4: Wirtz, M.Salah, Reijnders, N.Williams, Dúbravka, Estève, Sánchez, Muñoz, Diouf, Van de Ven, Rogers. Wait, AVL isn't playing in GW4? Because the fixtures for GW4 are M.Salah vs BUR, Reijnders vs MUN, Wirtz vs BUR, Dúbravka vs LIV, Estève vs LIV. So Watkins' team (AVL) isn't listed in the next three gameweeks. Wait, AVL's fixtures in GW4 might be a BYE. If that's the case, he won't get points for GW4. Then in GW5, AVL's game is against MUN (A, FDR 4), which is tough. GW6 is against LIV (H, FDR 3), so he's only playing in GW5 and GW6. 

So Watkins isn't playing in GW4, which is the next gameweek. If the user can replace him with a player who has a game in GW4, that might be better. The bench doesn't have a forward that plays in GW4 unless they bring in someone from the bench. Wait, the bench has Wood (NFO) who in GW4 plays against BUR (FDR 2.5). Maybe swapping Watkins for Wood could help in GW4. But the user's team value is £100.6m, and they have £0.6m bank. So selling Watkins (£8.9m) and buying Wood would give them a £0.6m bank, but since Wood is already on the bench, maybe they need to rotate him in instead of Watkins. However, the user has 1 free transfer. They could use it to replace Watkins with someone else. But if they have no bank, they can't buy a
